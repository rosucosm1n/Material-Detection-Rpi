# Material-Detection-Rpi
Graduate Thesis

The project proposes an embedded system designed for automatic material detection to support recycling efforts. It utilizes a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with an infrared sensor (TCRT5000) for reflectance measurement and a Pi Camera 3 for image-based analysis. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) processes captured frames in real time to classify materials into categories such as plastic, glass, or cardboard. The system continuously reads sensor data via an ADS1115 ADC to enhance decision accuracy. By combining hardware sensing with machine learning, it provides a cost-effective and scalable solution for waste sorting. This approach aims to encourage efficient recycling and reduce environmental impact.
